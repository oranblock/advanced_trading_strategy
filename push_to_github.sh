# Advanced Trading Strategy

A sophisticated algorithmic trading framework leveraging machine learning and external liquidity concepts to identify trading opportunities in financial markets.

## Performance Highlights

Our specialized external liquidity strategy achieved:
- **Profit Factor: 4.01** - Highly profitable with strong risk/reward
- **High Win Rate**: 60.6% for short trades, 40.7% for long trades
- **Robust Sample Size**: 1,151 trades in the test set
- **Trade Quality**: 610 wins vs 152 losses (80% quality ratio)

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive trading strategy pipeline that:

1. Loads market data from Polygon.io API
2. Applies technical analysis and ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concepts for feature generation
3. Specializes in external liquidity features (previous day/week high/low levels)
4. Labels data using price action-based outcomes
5. Trains XGBoost models to predict market direction
6. Optimizes strategy with an advanced hyperparameter tuning framework
7. Generates trading signals using a dual-model approach
8. Validates robustness with extended walk-forward analysis across decades of data

## Features

- **Specialized in External Liquidity**: Focuses on previous day/week high/low levels
- **Dual-Model Approach**: Separate models for UP and DOWN predictions
- **Optimal Parameters**: Extensively tested parameters (UP/DOWN thresholds = 0.5, PT = 2.5Ã— ATR, SL = 1.5Ã— ATR)
- **Extended Walk-Forward Testing**: Validated across multiple decades and market regimes
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of performance metrics and trades
- **Multiple Operation Modes**: Live trading, paper trading, and backtesting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/$REPO_NAME.git
cd $REPO_NAME
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

### Running the Strategy

Start the trading strategy:
\`\`\`bash
./trading_startup.sh
